<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello! My name is Patrice Banks. I am a first genertation college student pursing a Graduate Certificate in Technical Communication. I currently work as an animal care supervisor directly coordinating activities of husbandry care workers for animals used in biomedical research. I also contribute to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit empowering youth with hands-on education rooted in sustainability and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>My interest in technical writing is fueled by my passion of language skills and applying research-driven approaches to workplaces.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p> My interests include exploring visual communications in educational and research settings. I would like to use my professional and educational background to expand and customize curriculum and work cross-functionally with teams to develop user guides, training manuals, and tutorials. My current work in providing research support in addition to supervisory and nonprofit experience should provide a strong basis for work in scientific and technical communication. </p>
